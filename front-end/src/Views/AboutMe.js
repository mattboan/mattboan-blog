					<h2>Matt Boan</h2>
					<p>
						To me there is nothing more rewarding than solving an interesting problem.
						Once a problem nests itself into my head I immediately start learning as
						much as possible. Understanding a problem helps but is really only the first
						step to the cure, to really understand it in my own way I delve deeper and
						start to break the problem down into smaller pieces, figure out what the
						solution is for each piece and work backwards from the solution. Once the
						problem seems solved I test vigorously and iterate over slightly different
						designs to achieve the best possible solution.
						<br />
						<br />
						Iâ€™m <b>BIG</b> on teamwork. Throughout my studies and various side ventures,
						being able to share my passions, solve problems, and work within a group is
						like surfing a wave, itâ€™s fun but itâ€™s even more fun when you have someone
						to share the wave with.
